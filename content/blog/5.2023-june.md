## Personal Updates

### Flores

We spent the last week of our South East Asia trip in Flores, an island in Indonesia, east of Bali. 

Flores is known for many things, most famously Komodo dragons and Mt Kelimutu volcano.
It has a diverse landscape, with
many volcanos, jungles, beaches and rice terraces.

We did a road trip from West (Maumere) to East (Badjo), weaving along "spaghetti roads" through the mountains of
dense jungle.

We passed tiny villages as we went that offered a unique glimpse into the life of the Floresian and the Manggarai people.

Nearly everyone lived off the land, with rice being grown as the main source of food.
Most of the houses we passed had coffee beans or rice drying outside them.

As a fan of the bean, this was cool to see.
Occasionally we'd see someone roasting their coffee beans, which I also had a go at.

When inspecting the jungle, we'd always see something growing: mangos, bananas, passionfruit, cocoa, vanilla pods, taro, etc.
There was fresh fruit everywhere, and we occasionally got stopped by local kids selling us what they had just picked.

Our highlights were:
- Kelimutu volcano, which has 3 crater lakes at the top. These lakes change colour over time,
we were lucky enough to see them in their blue, green and black state.
- Rinca Island, seeing the Komodo's in their natural habitat.

### Australia: A wedding and camping

We finished our time in South East Asia after Flores, flying back to the Gold Coast, Australia.

It's winter time in Australia, so it was a bit of a shock to the system after 3 months of the heat and humidity.

Nonetheless, we hit up the beach and got a good swim in. 

We came back for a wedding which was really fun.
A good time catching up with family.

After the wedding we head off to the Warrumbungles.

The Warrumbungles is a national park north-east of Sydney which is best known for its amazing night sky.

We camped there for a few days, doing some hikes and exploring the area.
The highlight was the Breadknife and high tops hike, which had some amazing views and the nights sky lived up to its hype.

After that we spent time in the Blue Mountains and Sydney catching up with family and friends, planning the Europe leg of our trip.

## Work Updates

June was an important month of work,
getting things ready for the next major releases of many of my Nuxt modules.

The main blocker was Nuxt OG Image which had continued to plague me with issues.

With some luck and _many_ hours of work, I was able to get it to a state where it's mostly working correctly on all
major runtimes and was able to unblock myself.
 
This was a huge relief, and I'm looking forward to pushing out all Nuxt SEO modules in the coming months.

## Numbers / Financials

- ‚≠ê 6112 GitHub stars (+705)
