## My Journey

In  early 2023, I moved from AEINS GmbH to K√úS Data Gmbh to broaden my horizons in the business world :icon{name="flat-color-icons:business-contact" alt="Business Card"}.

I've been passionate about web development, working on diverse projects, and have substantial experience with various operating systems :icon{name="icon-park:coordinate-system" alt="Operating Systems Icon"}.

I believe in the importance of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), tailoring the experience to the user's needs :icon{name="icon-park:web-page" alt="Web-page Icon"}.

Throughout my career, I've led many projects and am comfortable working in or leading a team :icon{name="fluent:people-team-28-filled" alt="Team Icon"}.

Outside work, I love music :icon{name="simple-icons:pioneerdj" alt="PioneerDJ Icon"}, traveling :icon{name="mdi:airplane" alt="Plane Icon"}, sports :icon{name="fluent:sport-soccer-16-regular" alt="Sports Icon"}, and motorsports :icon{name="ion:car-sport" alt="car Icon"} .

I see myself as a team player, always eager to learn, valuing independence and responsibility, and I'm not afraid to take the lead. I love to ignite innovation with creativity :icon{name="flat-color-icons:idea" alt="Idea Icon"} .

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/omgitsjan) :icon{name="mdi:github"  alt="Github Icon"}.

Welcome! Let's talk :icon{name="twemoji:speech-balloon"  alt="speech Icon"} .

## Paid Work

When not working 9/5, I work for myself and trying to build a SaaS Product with [JPProfessionals](https://jpprofessionals.de/).

I partner with local business to create sites that users and search engines love. With a focus
on UX, SEO and performance. I build with :icon{name="logos:nuxt-icon" alt="Nuxt Icon"} Nuxt and :icon{name="logos:dotnet" class="h-1.2em w-1.2em ml-2 mr-1" alt="Dotnet Icon"} .NET.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:mail@janpetry.de){title="Send an email to me at mail@janpetry.de"} any exciting opportunities you have.
