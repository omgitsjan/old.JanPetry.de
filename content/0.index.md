## My Journey

In early 2023, I've begin to work for a Association for Technical Inspection to broaden my horizons in the business world :icon{alt="Business Card" name="flat-color-icons:business-contact"}.

I've been passionate about web development, working on diverse projects, and have substantial experience with various operating systems :icon{alt="Operating Systems Icon" name="icon-park:coordinate-system"}.

I believe in the importance of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), tailoring the experience to the user's needs :icon{alt="Web-page Icon" name="icon-park:web-page"}.

Throughout my career, I've led many projects and am comfortable working in or leading a team :icon{alt="Team Icon" name="fluent:people-team-28-filled"}.

Outside work, I love music :icon{alt="PioneerDJ Icon" name="simple-icons:pioneerdj"}, traveling :icon{alt="Plane Icon" name="mdi:airplane"}, sports :icon{alt="Sports Icon" name="fluent:sport-soccer-16-regular"}, and motorsports :icon{alt="car Icon" name="ion:car-sport"} .

I see myself as a team player, always eager to learn, valuing independence and responsibility, and I'm not afraid to take the lead. I love to ignite innovation with creativity :icon{alt="Idea Icon" name="flat-color-icons:idea"} .

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/omgitsjan) :icon{alt="Github Icon" name="mdi:github"}.

Welcome! Let's talk :icon{alt="speech Icon" name="twemoji:speech-balloon"} .

## Paid Work

When not working 9/5, I work for myself and trying to build a SaaS Product with [JPProfessionals](https://github.com/JPProfessionals).

I partner with local business to create sites that users and search engines love. With a focus
on UX, SEO and performance. I build with :icon{alt="Nuxt Icon" name="logos:nuxt-icon"} Nuxt and :icon{.ml-2.mr-1 class="h-1.2em w-1.2em" alt="Dotnet Icon" name="logos:dotnet"} .NET.

Feel free to [email me](mailto\:mail@janpetry.de "Send an email to me at mail@janpetry.de") any exciting opportunities you have.
