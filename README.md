# JanPetry.de

This is my personal website, built using Nuxt 3 and powered by [nuxt-seo-kit](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-seo-kit) as well as [Docus](https://docus.dev/).

The website is designed as a reference point for best practices with Nuxt code, SEO, performance, and accessibility.

Please note that this repository is mainly a personalized configuration of the original project created by Harlan Zwierlein (harlan-zw). Most of the credit for this project should be attributed to him. If you are interested in the original project, I highly recommend checking out his work.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000
